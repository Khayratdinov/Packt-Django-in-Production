### **2. Answers to Key Control Questions**

#### 1. **What is Django Admin, and what is it used for?**  
Django Admin is a built-in administrative interface that is automatically generated to manage application data. It allows administrators to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via a user-friendly interface and provides customization options for various business requirements.

---

#### 2. **How can you create a superuser in Django? Provide an example command.**  
To create a superuser, you can use the built-in `createsuperuser` command. Example:  
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
This command launches an interactive prompt asking for the username, email, and password.

---

#### 3. **How do you register a model in Django Admin? Provide a code example.**  
Models can be registered in the `admin.py` file. Example:  
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from blog.models import Blog

class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

admin.site.register(Blog, BlogAdmin)
```
This code adds the `Blog` model to the Django Admin interface.

---

#### 4. **What attributes can be used in the `ModelAdmin` class to customize the interface?**  
Some key attributes of `ModelAdmin` include:  
- `list_display` — Specifies which fields to display in the list view.  
- `search_fields` — Adds a search bar for specified fields.  
- `list_filter` — Adds filters for the list view.  
- `date_hierarchy` — Adds date navigation.  
- `filter_horizontal` / `filter_vertical` — Enhances the interface for `ManyToManyField`.

Example:  
```python
class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['title', 'created_at']
    search_fields = ['title']
    list_filter = ['created_at']
    date_hierarchy = 'created_at'
```

---

#### 5. **How can you add a custom field to the list of displayed columns in Django Admin?**  
To add a custom field, define a method in the `ModelAdmin` class. Example:  
```python
class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'word_count')

    def word_count(self, obj):
        return len(obj.content.split())
```
Here, the `word_count` field is calculated dynamically based on the model's content.

---

#### 6. **What is `filter_horizontal`, and how is it used?**  
`filter_horizontal` improves the interface for selecting related objects in `ManyToManyField`. Example:  
```python
class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    filter_horizontal = ['tags']
```
This converts the default interface into a more user-friendly horizontal list.

---

#### 7. **How can you override the `get_queryset` method in Django Admin, and why is it necessary?**  
The `get_queryset` method is overridden to optimize database queries. Example:  
```python
class BlogAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    def get_queryset(self, request):
        qs = super().get_queryset(request)
        return qs.select_related('author')
```
This avoids the N+1 query problem, improving performance.

---

#### 8. **How do you configure custom management commands in Django? Provide an example folder structure.**  
To create a custom management command, you need the following folder structure:  
```
<app_name>/
    management/
        commands/
            my_command.py
```
Example command:  
```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Example command'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        print("Hello from custom command!")
```
Run the command with:  
```bash
python manage.py my_command
```

---

#### 9. **How do you add arguments to a custom management command?**  
Use the `add_arguments` method to add arguments. Example:  
```python
class Command(BaseCommand):
    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument('my_arg', type=int)

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        print(f"Argument: {options['my_arg']}")
```
Run the command with:  
```bash
python manage.py my_command 42
```

---

#### 10. **What tips and best practices are recommended for optimizing Django Admin in production?**  
- Rename the default `/admin` URL for better security.  
- Use two-factor authentication (2FA).  
- Disable dropdowns for `ForeignKey` fields using `raw_id_fields`.  
- Configure custom paginators for large tables.  
- Use `list_select_related` and `get_queryset` to optimize queries.  
- Restrict access to logs through `LogEntryAdmin`.
